Repository for Powershell scripts for management of Microsoft Teams

If you're reading this, welcome! My name is Doug Schaefer and I'm a Microsoft Solutions Architect for Diversified.  This repository is for all Powershell commands that I use for the purposes of managing Exchange Online accounts, Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Teams Rooms, and honestly pretty much everything possible that one can manage using Powershell.  All commands here have been ran and tested by me on my test tenant using Powershell ISE with elevated credentials.  Most of these are just scripts that I've modified or directly copied from various Microsoft Docs so I do not in any way consider this my own intellectual property at all, but if you want to credit me for their use, my info is below.  Thanks and happy scripting!
